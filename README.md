# Primordial Particle System
Simplistic 2d particle system focused on the emergence of complex patterns from simple rules.

## Particle behaviour
Somewhat similar to the *Game of Life*, particles move and interact within a 2d plain. 
Each particle moves with a fixed speed and performs a rotation each step, modifying its heading direction 
according to the presence of other particles in its vicinity. These simple rules, when parameterized correctly,
can give way to particularly complex behaviours involving several particles forming conglomerates and acting as
groups, hence showing the emergence principle in action.
